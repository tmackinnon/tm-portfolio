          Hi there! I&apos;m Tara, a full-stack web developer based in Vancouver, BC.

        <p className='text-2xl mb-4'>
            With a background in fundraising and not-for-profits, my desire to make a meaningful difference has been a constant driving force.
            As I transition into a career in tech, that motivation persists and I am inspired by the industry&apos;s potential to address the social and environmental challenges of today.
            I firmly believe that the power of tech can be harnessed to create innovative solutions and I am excited to play a role in driving that positive change.
